## Practical Machine Learning: Course Project

This repo contains the work for the course project of Practical Machine Learning.

The raw data CSV files are contained here along with the report's Rmd/md/HTML files.

The report illustrates and discusses application of machine learning algorithms on a data set of accelerometer measurements. The goal is to train an algorithm which can then correctly classify the quality of an exercise (barbell lift) for an unlabeled set of data.
